  	<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>C. Brandon Ogbunu is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Brown University. He is an evolutionary systems biologist, and uses experimental evolution, mathematical modeling, and computational biology to better understand how adaptive evolution occurs in nature, mainly in microbial models of disease. In doing so, he aims to develop theory that enriches our understanding of the evolutionary process and contributes to practical solutions for clinical medicine and public health.   
<br />
<br />	
<!--
Through collaboration with laboratory, field, and public health researchers, the mathematical and computational models we develop are interrogated with novel experiments, evaluated on new data sources, and applied to public health and clincal problems.  Our surveillance research, for example, is done in close association with state, national, and international public health agencies and has led to substantive changes in surveillance practices. I believe this type of collaboration between scientists and public health decision makers is critical for efficient, effective outbreak preparedness and response.  
<br />
<br />
Beyond disease, the group's research has focused on a variety of topics, including animal movement and group dynamics; traffic routing; the effects of environmental toxins on behavior and neural biology; and models of spatiotemporal variation in tree density and fruiting phenology.
